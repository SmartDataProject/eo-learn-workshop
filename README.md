# Workshop material for the `eo-learn` open-source package

This is a GitHub page for `eo-learn` designated workshops. The page contains some data sets and Jupyter notebooks for the workshop, such as:

- `timelapse_notebook.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook for getting to know EOTasks and EOWorkflows in a simple usecase of making a timelapse of a solar farm in Morocco.

- `water_level_extraction_notebook.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook that also uses some helper functions from the `utilities.py` file in order to detect the water surface level over a period of time

- add SI_LULC notebook and files (TODO)
