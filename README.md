# Workshop material for the `eo-learn` open-source package

This is a GitHub page for `eo-learn` designated workshops. The page contains some data sets and Jupyter notebooks for the workshop.

The `example_data` directory contains data, which are needed to run the examples.

The `outputs` directory contains all the output files and directories which are the result of running the notebooks.

In the `notebooks` directory, you can find the following Jupyter notebooks:
- `notebooks/1_introductory_notebook.ipynb` - A good place to start. The notebook shows you the ropes of `eo-learn`.

- `notebooks/2_timelapse_notebook.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook for getting to know EOTasks and EOWorkflows in a simple usecase of making a timelapse of a solar farm in Morocco.

- `notebooks/3_water_level_extraction_notebook.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook that also uses some helper functions from the `utilities.py` file in order to detect the water surface level of a water body over a period of time. This notebook also uses some functions from the `utilities.py` file.

- `notebooks/4_land_cover_notebook.ipynb` - A notebook that shows how to do land cover classification on a small part of Slovenia from start to finish.

Good luck!
